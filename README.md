# Startpage

This is a static html generator for my Firefox startpage. Yes, it is overkill, but it does some clever stuff, such as:

- Updates some RSS news feeds
- Grabs current weather and forecast
- Pulls my links from a seperate python file containing a dict of links

### Dependencies

Python2.7

### Running it

It will run as is. Just change the settings in runme.py and you're good to go. Ideally, you should run it part of an hourly cron job. 

### Customization

Have a read through the code, you'll figure out how to customize stuff.

### License

You're kidding, right? ^^
